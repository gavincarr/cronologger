This script will archive cron or for that matter any output
 to a CouchDB document. There are two main drivers
 - Reduce the amount of cron e-mail spam
 - Have logs of cron jobs that can be correlated to adverse events

To run it simply precede a command with the cronologger command ie.

  cronologger /usr/local/bin/backup_db.sh

To configure cronologger you simply have to configure URL_BASE
at the top of cronologger
